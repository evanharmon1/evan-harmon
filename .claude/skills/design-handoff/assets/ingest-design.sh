# ingest-design.sh — safely extract a Claude Design handoff bundle into specs/.
#
# Called by `task ingest:design` (Taskfile.design.yml), which passes BUNDLE and
# DEST through the ENVIRONMENT — never spliced into shell source — so a path
# like "x.tar.gz; rm -rf ~" stays an (invalid) filename and paths with spaces
# survive. The design-handoff skill copies this to scripts/ (chmod +x).
#
# The archive is UNTRUSTED input: entries are listed and validated before
# extraction. Absolute paths, ../ traversal, and link entries (symlink/hardlink,
# which can redirect later writes outside DEST) are rejected — the tar/zip-slip
# class of attack. Archive type is selected by validated extension: .tar.gz/.tgz
# or .zip (see references/ingesting-the-bundle.md on telling the coding handoff
# apart from the raw-assets .zip export).
#
# USAGE: BUNDLE=<bundle> [DEST=specs] ingest-design.sh
