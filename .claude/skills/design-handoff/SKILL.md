# Design Handoff (Claude Design → repo)

Turn a finished Claude Design into working, on-brand code in the Ponderous Development stack. The native Claude Design export drops a **handoff bundle** (standalone HTML/CSS/JS, screenshots, the tokens it used, and a README) into the repo; your job is to reconcile that generic bundle into _this repo's_ conventions — not to paste it in verbatim.

The core principle running through every step: **`src/styles/globals.css` is the canonical runtime token source, and `DESIGN.md` is the AI-facing statement of intent.** When they disagree, `globals.css` wins for runtime. The handoff bundle is the reference for the _intended_ design — it stays in place until **the user has reviewed the implementation and approved it**, and only then is it removed before merge. Never assume your implementation is correct; the user decides whether it matches the intent.

## Inputs

- A handoff bundle at `docs/design/handoff-<feature-or-description>/`. If you can't find one, ask the user where the export landed (or whether they've exported yet) before proceeding.
- The existing repo: `DESIGN.md` (root), `src/styles/globals.css`, `docs/design/`, `Taskfile.yml`, and the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Stack (target for all implementation)

TypeScript · React · Vite · Astro · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui · Cloudflare Pages. Favor **shadcn/ui** for components and **Lucide** for icons.

## Procedure

Work through these in order. Explanations of _why_ are included because they change how you make judgment calls.

### 0. Locate and read the bundle

`view` the `docs/design/handoff-<feature>/` directory. Read the README (it states the design intent and structure), look at the screenshots, and note the tokens and component structure it used. This is your spec — but it's a _generic_ spec, not yet adapted to the stack.

**Load the file the prototype actually renders, not a stale snapshot.** Claude Design exports cache-bust its scripts with query strings, e.g. `<script src="sections.jsx?v=18">`, and it _also_ writes a literal file named `sections.jsx?v=18` next to the canonical `sections.jsx`. Over `file://` the browser strips the `?v=…` query and loads the **plain** file (`sections.jsx`, `components.jsx`, `styles.css`, `app.jsx`) — so the canonical, current design lives in the **un-suffixed** files. The `…?v=N` files are older snapshots; reading them will have you implementing a version the user already iterated past. Open the entry HTML, see which sources it references, and read the plain-named files those resolve to. If two files differ, the larger/un-suffixed one is almost always current — confirm against the screenshots or ask.

### 1. Establish the canonical sources

Before changing anything, read the current `DESIGN.md` (root) and `src/styles/globals.css`. You need to know the existing token system so you _merge into_ it rather than overwrite it. shadcn's `globals.css` is a three-layer structure — `:root`/`.dark` semantic tokens in OKLCH, plus an `@theme inline` reference layer. Internalize that structure now; you'll merge into its semantic slots in step 3.

### 2. Reconcile tokens — **read `references/token-reconciliation.md`**

This is the most error-prone step, so it has its own detailed reference. **Read `references/token-reconciliation.md` and follow it.** In short: the design's token export is flat, light-mode-only, and often hex; shadcn needs three-layer, dual-mode, OKLCH, and semantic. You will map the design's colors into `globals.css` semantic slots **by role**, author the `.dark` block the export can't supply, and never hard-code values into `@theme inline`. Do not blind-paste the export.

To get the export into a scratch file for reference (never write it directly into `globals.css`):

```bash
task export:design   # writes .design/theme.scratch.css and .design/tokens.json
```

### 3. Update `DESIGN.md`

Make `DESIGN.md` (repo root) reflect the design: palette, type scale, spacing, radii, component rules, and the prose "do's and don'ts" that tokens can't capture. If Claude Design generated a `DESIGN.md`, reconcile it into the existing one rather than clobbering. `DESIGN.md` is the durable AI-facing record; the bundle is not.

### 4. Implement components in the stack

Build the UI in TypeScript/React with Astro. Use **shadcn/ui** components (check for existing ones before building custom) and **Lucide** icons (named imports so they tree-shake). Style **only** with the semantic tokens in `globals.css` — never arbitrary hex or one-off Tailwind color literals. Cover the states the bundle may not show: empty, loading, error, disabled.

**Build and maintain the brand page at `/brand`.** The design system ships a living style guide (in this stack the bundle's `design-system/Style Guide.html`, plus any `Logo System.html`). It is not throwaway reference — it must exist as a real, maintained route at **`/brand`**: the public, at-a-glance companion to `DESIGN.md` (intent prose) and `globals.css` (runtime tokens). Implement it in the stack (palette swatches with hex **and** OKLCH, type specimens + scale, logo/monogram lockups, ornaments, button/component specimens, the colour-block, and the OG share-card), styled with the semantic tokens so it tracks the theme toggle. Treat it as a standing deliverable: whenever tokens, type, or brand rules change, **update `/brand` in the same change** so it never drifts from `DESIGN.md`/`globals.css`. If a `/brand` route already exists, reconcile into it rather than duplicating. Link it discreetly (e.g. from the footer).

### 5. Handle assets

- **Static assets ship with the app** → the repo: logo variants and brand assets in `public/brand/`, content/marketing images in `public/images/` (stable URL) or `src/assets/` (when imported by a component, so Vite hashes/optimizes them). SVG for logos and vector art.
- **Dynamic / user-generated media** (e.g. customer photos) → **Cloudflare R2**, never the repo.
- **Favicons** → generate the full set (`.ico`, `apple-touch-icon`, PWA manifest icons) from the logo mark at build time (e.g. `vite-plugin-favicon`); don't hand-make sizes.
- **Fonts** → self-host OFL/Apache `.woff2` in `public/fonts/`, declared via `@font-face` with `font-display: swap`. Define families by role (`--font-sans`, `--font-display`, `--font-mono`) in `globals.css` under `@theme`. Prefer variable fonts. Remember the `@import` for any hosted font CSS must come _before_ `@import "tailwindcss"`.
- **Image formats**: prefer AVIF → WebP → PNG/JPEG; SVG for vector. Use responsive `srcset`/`sizes` and `loading="lazy"` below the fold.

### 6. Licensing gate (commercial-use check)

This repo ships commercial products, so **every font, icon, and image must permit commercial use.** Verify before committing:

- Fonts: OFL/Apache only (all Google Fonts qualify). Reject Helvetica/SF Pro/Gotham and other proprietary faces.
- Icons: Lucide (ISC) is safe. Flag Font Awesome free (CC-BY → attribution required).
- Images/stock: confirm the license — "free to download" ≠ "free for commercial use."
- **AI-generated logos**: flag to the human that a prompt-generated logo can usually be _trademarked_ but typically _not copyrighted_ (no human authorship), and recommend substantial human edits + a clearance search before it becomes the brand. Don't silently treat an AI logo as fully protected.

If any asset's license is unclear, **stop and flag it to the user** rather than guessing.

### 7. Run the checks (don't bypass hooks)

```bash
task lint:design   # canonical files; bans off-palette utilities; STATIC token-contrast gate; builds
task check         # typecheck + lint + format (fast static verification)
```

Then build to confirm it compiles. **Never use `--no-verify`** or otherwise skip git hooks — the hooks and CI are authoritative gates, and bypassing them defeats the point.

**Contrast is checked at TWO levels — keep both.**

1. **Static token contrast (here).** `task lint:design` runs a checker that parses the semantic colour tokens out of `globals.css` and proves every foreground/background pair the design relies on meets **WCAG AA in both themes** (4.5:1 text; 3:1 large/UI; purely decorative accents like gilt-on-paper are reported but exempt). This catches a bad palette early and must stay green. If you add a text role or surface, add its pair to the checker.
2. **Rendered contrast (step 8).** The static gate is **necessary but not sufficient** — it sees the _tokens_, not the colour that actually paints. A third-party component layer can override your colour at runtime (e.g. the Tailwind Typography plugin's `.prose` defaults sit in a later cascade layer and replace `--tw-prose-body` with a dark grey, so long-form/dark-mode body renders illegibly even though `ink/ink-soft` are correct). So you **also** measure the computed colour on the running page — see step 8.

Both must pass. Token math alone is not a contrast guarantee; rendered measurement alone misses palette regressions the static gate would catch on every build.

### 8. Verify against the design and get the user's sign-off (REQUIRED)

**Do not assume the implementation is correct, and do not proceed to cleanup on your own judgment.** Before anything is deleted, show the user the result and ask them to approve it.

1. **Make it viewable.** Run the app (`task dev` / the project's run skill) and exercise the implemented screens. Capture screenshots of each implemented view, in **both light and dark mode**, and for the states you built (default, empty, loading, error).
2. **Measure rendered contrast (don't trust the tokens).** On the running pages, read the **computed** colour of real text against its real background and compute the WCAG ratio — in **both themes**, and for every text role: body, headings, muted/meta, links, on-colour-block text, and **especially long-form prose / article bodies** (the place third-party layers like the typography plugin override your colours). A quick way: in the browser, `getComputedStyle(el).color` vs the element's background, run the WCAG ratio, and require **≥ 4.5:1** (≥ 3:1 for large text). If anything fails, fix it (e.g. pull the override out of the cascade layer so your token wins) and re-measure before showing the user. Report the measured ratios in your summary — never claim "passes AA" without a number.
3. **Compare to the bundle.** Put your screenshots next to the bundle's screenshots / `DESIGN.md` intent and call out any deltas you already know about (things you adapted, simplified, or deferred).
4. **Ask explicitly.** Use `AskUserQuestion` (or a direct question) to ask whether the implemented design looks right — e.g. "Does this match the intended design, or are there things to fix before I remove the handoff files?" Surface known compromises so the user is deciding with full information.
5. **Iterate until approved.** If the user wants changes, make them and re-verify. **Loop here — do not advance — until the user explicitly approves.** Approval is the user's call, never yours.

The handoff bundle stays fully in place for this entire step: it is the reference the user compares against.

### 9. Clean up the bundle — only after explicit approval

**Gate:** only do this once the user has approved the implementation in step 8. If approval hasn't been given, **leave `docs/design/handoff-<feature>/` exactly where it is** — it represents the intended design and must outlive an unverified implementation.

Once approved, **delete `docs/design/handoff-<feature>/`** so a stale runnable snapshot can't later mislead an agent into treating it as a source of truth. The only exception: if the design includes states not yet built, extract a _thin_ screenshot + intent note into the relevant spec first, then delete the rest. The durable records are the merged code, the updated `DESIGN.md`/`globals.css`, and any decision record.

### 10. Update human docs and flag decisions

- Update relevant files in `docs/design/` (`brand.md`, `design-system.md`, `components.md`, `accessibility.md`) and **the `/brand` page (step 4) whenever brand-level things changed — keep it in lockstep with `DESIGN.md`/`globals.css`.**
- If this design embodied a genuine, debatable design-system decision (a new token architecture choice, a palette philosophy shift), tell the user it warrants a **DDR** in `/decisions/`. Don't write architecture decisions into this skill or into `DESIGN.md` prose — they belong in a decision record.
- Use Conventional Commits. The bot/agent never merges to `main` directly — open a PR for human review of the diff.

---

## Guardrails (apply throughout)

- **Get sign-off before deleting anything.** The handoff bundle is the record of the _intended_ design. Never delete `docs/design/handoff-<feature>/` (or any handoff file) until the user has reviewed the implementation and explicitly approved it. Approval is the user's decision; don't infer it from a green build or your own confidence.
- **Semantic tokens only.** Never introduce arbitrary hex or one-off Tailwind color literals. Use the `globals.css` semantic tokens.
- **`globals.css` wins over `DESIGN.md`** for runtime. If they drift, flag it.
- **`/brand` is a maintained route, not a doc.** Build it from the design's style guide and keep it synced with the tokens; never let it drift.
- **Read the canonical source files**, not the `?v=N` cache-busted snapshots the export leaves beside them.
- **One icon set: Lucide.** Don't mix icon libraries.
- **OFL/Apache fonts only**, self-hosted.
- **OKLCH** for color values; **three-tier semantic** token naming (primitive → semantic → component).
- **WCAG AA (4.5:1)** contrast — enforced at **both** levels: the **static token gate** in `task lint:design` (palette fg/bg pairs, both themes) **and** a **rendered measurement** on the running page (step 8), in both themes. Token math passing is not enough on its own ("it looks fine" never counts); long-form prose and third-party-rendered text are the usual rendered failures.
- **Don't bypass hooks** (`--no-verify` is prohibited).
- **Conventional Commits**; PR for human review; no direct merges to `main`.

## Reference files

- **`references/token-reconciliation.md`** — the detailed recipe for merging the Claude Design token export into shadcn's three-layer OKLCH semantic structure, including authoring dark mode. Read it during step 2.

## Complements

This skill handles the _reconciliation and wiring_. It pairs well with the `frontend-design` skill (anti-"AI-slop" aesthetic direction) during step 4. It does not depend on any third-party skill.
