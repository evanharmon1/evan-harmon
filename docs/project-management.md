# Project Management

How work is tracked for Evan Harmon Website in **GitHub Projects**.

## One default project per owner

The standard strategy is a single default GitHub **Project (V2)** per owner — one
board for the organization, or (for personal-account repos) one for the user
account — titled after the owner's GitHub login: `<owner> Project` (here:
**evanharmon1 Project**; e.g. `harmonops Project`, `evanharmon1 Project`).
Every repo the owner controls feeds that one board; an issue can belong to
multiple projects, but this default board is its home. Reach for a second,
focused project only when a body of work needs its own.

## Status pipeline

`Status` is a single-select field with exactly one meaning: **where in the flow
toward delivery is this.** The columns, grouped:

**Backlog** — triage; not yet committed

- Inbox — newly landed, unsorted
- Icebox — real, but not now
- Next — will pull in soon

**Unstarted** — committed to a cycle, not yet in motion

- Todo
- Shaping — problem/approach still being defined
- Ready — shaped, ready to pick up
- Agent Queue — queued for an AI agent to implement

**Started** — in motion, partial progress

- In Progress
- Verifying — CI/checks running
- In Review — under human review
- Ready to Merge — approved, awaiting merge

**Completed**

- Done — merged/shipped; the single terminal status
- Deployed
- Accepted — smoke/QA/manual check passed, communicated, released

Archiving isn't a status — it's a separate native axis. GitHub's built-in
**auto-archive** removes finished items from the board (into the retrievable
Archived-items view), so aged `Done` items leave the board automatically instead
of sitting in an "Archived" column.

**Agent Queue is the hand-off lane to AI coding agents.** An item lands there once
it's shaped and ready for an *agent* rather than a human to implement — the
**Agent** field says which one (and effort / model). Today the hand-off is manual:
assign the agent and trigger it (a `claude-*` workflow, or point Claude Code at the
item). The lane is built for future automation, though — an agent can watch *Agent
Queue + Agent-set + priority* (the Agent-queue view below) and pull the top item on
its own — and either way the item moves to **In Progress** once work starts.

> **Foreman is that automation** for issue-driven delivery: arm the issue
> (`foreman:*` label, or the org `foreman` issue field) and
> `task foreman:dispatch` / `foreman:watch` pulls ready items, opens verified
> PRs, and shepherds them to a human merge. The Project stays the human
> dashboard — foreman neither reads nor writes it (issue state, labels/fields,
> and PRs are its interface). See `docs/architecture/foreman.md`.

## Status is not issue state

GitHub has **two independent state machines**, and conflating them is the most
common way to make a board lie:

- **Issue state** — `open` / `closed`, native to the issue.
- **Status** — the custom pipeline field above, layered on top.

`Status` answers *"where in the delivery flow is this."* It is **not** where you
record *why something left the flow without shipping* — GitHub has a dedicated
axis for that, the **close reason**.

### Canceled and Duplicate are close reasons, not statuses

They aren't pipeline positions; they're terminal closure reasons, and GitHub
already has an axis for those that's separate from `Status` by design. When you
close an issue you pick **Completed**, **Not planned**, or **Duplicate**:

- **Cancel / won't-fix / stale** → close as **Not planned** — explicitly the
  bucket for exactly this.
- **Duplicate** → close as **Duplicate** (shipped December 2024). You select the
  duplicated issue, which produces a timeline event and a note at the top making
  the closure reason clear.

Neither needs a `Status` value, and **Done** stays the single terminal status
meaning "shipped." Why not add `Canceled`/`Duplicate` columns anyway, given
Linear has a Canceled group? Because in Linear the status *is* the state, so
"Canceled" closes the work atomically with that meaning. GitHub split them:
`Status` is a custom field layered on an issue that keeps its own independent
open/closed state.

### Automation gotcha

The built-in **"issue closed → Done"** rule doesn't look at *why* the issue
closed, so closing something as Not planned or Duplicate would paint it **Done**
on the board — wrong. Gate it:

- Drive Done off **"PR merged → Done"** for the success path.
- On a raw close event, check `state_reason == completed` before setting Done.

Items closed as not-planned/duplicate just stay closed and fall off the board;
their `Status` value goes vestigial, which is fine — nothing open-filtered shows
them.

## Blocked is not a status

A `Blocked` column buys you visibility you already get for free, and it fights
automation: statuses are artifact-driven (PR opened → Verifying) while "blocked"
is a manual human overlay — an item that's "Blocked" but has an open PR is a
contradiction the automation can't resolve. Blocked is **orthogonal** to pipeline
position; keep it off that axis. There are two kinds, and they want different
tools:

- **Blocked by another issue** (the common case) — use the native **"Mark as
  blocked by"** relationship (issue dependencies, GA 2025-08-21). It records
  *what's* blocking (the actual issue, not a bare flag), shows the **Blocked**
  icon on the board and Issues page automatically, is queryable with
  `is:blocked`, and is fully programmatic (`gh issue view` shows Blocked by /
  Blocking; `--json blockedBy,blocking`; REST endpoints add/list/remove).
  When the blocker closes, the relationship reflects it. Up to 50 issues per
  relationship type.
- **Blocked by a non-issue** — waiting on a Twilio 10DLC approval, an upstream
  library fix, a pricing decision, info from a customer. The native feature can't
  express this (an issue only becomes "blocked" by depending on another issue),
  so this is the **`blocked` label's** job: it means "stuck on a non-issue
  thing," with the actual reason in a comment.

One upgrade for that second case: model a *significant or shared* external
blocker as its own **tracking issue** ("Twilio 10DLC brand approval") and mark
the real work blocked-by it — that pulls the external dependency into the native
mechanism (board icon, `is:blocked`, auto-resolve). Worth it when several items
wait on the same thing; reserve the bare label for one-off, transient blockers.

## Automations

Projects are **org-level** objects, but automations trigger from **events**, and
issue/PR events are repo-local. That splits automation three ways:

1. **Triggered by repo activity (issue/PR events)** — the workflow *must* live in
   the repo where the activity happens; a workflow in one repo never sees
   another's PR events. In a polyrepo org the same automation runs in every repo
   whose issues/PRs feed the project.
2. **Triggered by a schedule or `workflow_dispatch`** — no per-repo trigger to
   distribute, so pick one hub/ops repo and run it there.
3. **Not an Action at all** — the project's **built-in workflows**.

Start with #3: **push everything you can onto the built-in workflows.** They're
configured on the project itself, fire on project-item events, and work
org-project-wide across every repo with zero Actions and zero per-repo setup —
Backlog on add, In Review on review-requested, Done on merge, Done on close,
auto-close, auto-archive. Drop to Actions only for the gaps built-ins don't
cover.

TODO: finalize exactly what to automate. The intended event → status shape:

- New issue → **Inbox**
- Branch/PR started → **In Progress**
- PR opened → **In Review**
- Deployment complete → verification (if applicable)
- Issue closed (`state_reason == completed`) → **Done**
- 90 days in Done → **auto-archived** off the board (native built-in, not a Status)

## Fields

`Status` is a **Project field** — the board pipeline above; it stays on the
project because the built-in workflows (and `project-automation.yml`, on an org)
drive it.

The work-metadata fields:

- **Priority** — Urgent / High / Medium / Low
- **Size** — estimation points on the Fibonacci ladder (1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 8 / 13 / 21),
  a project **number** field so a view can sum it per group
- **Product** — which product/area it belongs to (free text)
- **Agent** — which agent should implement it (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
  Qwen Code, DeepSeek, Kimi K2, GLM, GitHub Copilot) and how (effort level, model)

On a personal account there are no issue fields, so `task setup:github-project`
creates **Priority, Product, Agent, and Size** as project fields.

TODO: finalize each field's options/values.

## Labels

Labels are **repo-level** and orthogonal to `Status` (pipeline position) and
`Type` (kind of work) — they tag cross-cutting *facets*. Keep them in a few
families, color-coded by family; the starter set is created by
`task setup:github-labels`:

- **Concerns** — `sec`, `a11y`, `perf`, `tech-debt`, `i18n`, `l10n`
- **Source** — `customer-request`, `ai-generated`
- **Workflow** — `needs-triage`, `needs-requirements`, `blocked`, `waiting`,
  `needs-decision`, `needs-response`, `needs-communication` (transient triage
  states; `blocked` is the non-issue-blocker flag described above)
- **Layer** — `layer:frontend`, `layer:backend`, `layer:infra`, …
- **Domain** — start with `domain:auth`, `domain:billing`; grow from your ERD
  entities

GitHub labels live per-repository (there's no shared org label pool).
`setup-github-labels` seeds the set into one repo — run it in each, or set the
org's **default labels** (org Settings → Repository, UI-only) to seed *new* repos
(it won't change existing ones). It never deletes labels, so GitHub's defaults
remain until you prune them.

## Milestones

A milestone has **one job — "when it ships"** — and nothing else. Four things
could all masquerade as milestones, so keep the lanes clean:

- **Type** — what kind of work (Bug / Feature / Task / Research)
- **Status** — where it sits in the pipeline
- **Labels** — orthogonal, cross-cutting concerns
- **Sub-issues** — hierarchy

None of those answers *"which dated, shippable batch does this belong to, and how
done is that batch?"* — that's the milestone's unique contribution: a
release/launch container with a **due date** and a **live completion bar**. Labels
for classification, milestones for goal tracking. The moment you're making a
milestone that isn't a dated, shippable batch, it's really a label or a saved
view.

**Name milestones after release versions** — the milestone title *equals* the git
tag (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`). Then the milestone list doubles as a release-history /
changelog skeleton, and closing a milestone on publish needs no special plumbing.
This dovetails with **release-please** because they run at different times and
never overlap:

- The **milestone** is the *pre-ship planning* artifact — "what must land before
  we cut `v1.1.0`."
- **release-please** is the *post-merge machine* that calculates and cuts the
  actual version from your conventional commits (see
  [conventions.md](conventions.md)).

Naming them identically makes the two legible to each other — the shipped
`close-milestone-on-release.yml` Action closes the milestone matching a published
tag (when release-please is on) — without making them one system. Since PRs and
issues share the milestone namespace, the release PR itself
can carry the milestone, so the shipped batch is fully self-documenting.

**One active release milestone at a time (rolling).** Carry one open milestone per
release line — created when it has real scope and a date, closed when it ships,
the next opened only as needed. Not five speculative open milestones competing for
attention.

**Due dates are signals, not gates.** A milestone's due date doesn't block a merge
or a close and triggers nothing — it's a communication tool; update it honestly
when the plan slips. That's where milestones earn their keep on a team: the dated
milestone is the shared artifact that tells collaborators what's shipping and
roughly when — worth more with others in the loop than in pure solo work.

## Milestones over iterations

For pre-launch product development, lead with **milestones, not iterations**
(sprints). The mechanisms differ in what they fix vs. flex:

- **Iterations fix time, flex scope** — the window ends Friday, you ship whatever's
  done.
- **Milestones fix scope, flex time** — you ship when the thing is done; the date
  is a signal.

Early product work needs to **fix scope**: a half-built product at an arbitrary
time-box boundary isn't shippable value — "ship it when it's good enough to charge
for" is a scope commitment, not a time one. Here the milestone's commitment shape
is right and the iteration's is actively wrong.

**Incremental delivery doesn't come from either mechanism** — it comes from **small
slices + frequent deploys + a release cadence**, which you already have (PR-sized
sub-issues, per-PR previews to prod, release-please cutting incremental releases
from accumulated commits). You can sprint and ship zero user value, or run
milestones and ship continuously; the delivery job routes through the *release*
mechanism (milestone-adjacent), not sprints.

**So run small, frequent milestones** — a shippable chunk every ~2–4 weeks, not one
giant "Launch." A tightly-scoped milestone with a target date is a chunk of value
with an expectation attached, doing three jobs at once: coordination (toward
shippable scope), commitment (to that scope; date as signal), and incremental
delivery (frequent small releases). It's literally the release-please flow —
**small frequent milestones == frequent small releases** — so it's one rhythm, not
two.

**Get the forcing-function from tools you already have,** not a sprint clock: a
**WIP limit** on `In Progress`, sub-issues **sized to one PR**, and continuous
deploy — anti-drag pressure applied at the work slice, not a calendar boundary a
tiny team can't make hard anyway.

**Why this phase picks milestones:** early development is **discovery-driven** —
you're figuring out scope as you go, capacity is erratic, and the priority is
shipping the *right* thing, not a predictable amount. Iterations shine in the
opposite regime (a known backlog, steady team, predictable capacity metered at a
constant clip) — steady-state maturity, not pre-launch. (Honest counter:
time-boxing can curb rabbit-holing during discovery — but the Lean answer is
build-measure-learn, get it in front of a user fast, for which the clock is your
**deploy cadence**, not a two-week sprint; and a WIP limit plus one-PR slices curb
it at the work level more directly. You already have those.)

**Iterations also don't fit the agent queue.** Agents run when triggered, not "this
week"; scoping the queue to `iteration:@current` adds nothing over *agent-set +
Ready + priority*. Iteration is a human-cadence concept your agents don't have.
(The native Iteration field stays available if you reach steady-state and want it.)

## Hierarchy (sub-issues, not Epics)

There's **no Epic type, by design.** The "big initiative" role splits cleanly
into two natives — **sub-issues** carry the *hierarchy* axis and **milestones**
carry the *release* axis — and GitHub stitches them together for you: a
**sub-issue inherits its parent's Project and Milestone by default** (shipped
2025-09). Assign them once on the parent and the child tree picks them up — no
per-child bookkeeping.

So a parent issue "Scheduling v1" in milestone `v1.1.0` pulls its whole subtree
into that release payload for free. Break big work down with **sub-issues** (up to
8 levels — flip on **Show hierarchy** in a view to expand/collapse the tree)
rather than a markdown checklist or an Epic type: you get the structure without
the "Feature or Epic?" tax.

**Sub-issues are your only hierarchy axis; everything else stays flat.** Type,
Status, milestone, labels, and fields must never try to encode "part of" — that's
the sub-issue's job, and only that. Once that's clear, the rest is just sizing and
deciding what metadata rides on the parent vs. the leaves.

**The three-tier shape (replaces Epic → Story → Task with natives):** a
**milestone** (the dated release batch — possibly-unrelated work) contains parent
**Feature** issues (each a cohesive capability), each of which contains **Task**
sub-issues (mergeable slices). Full hierarchy, no synthetic Epic.

The boundary that trips people up: **a milestone is a flat batch of unrelated
features targeting a date; a parent issue is one cohesive thing decomposed.** So
don't build a giant "Launch" parent with 40 sub-issues spanning unrelated features
— that's exactly what the milestone is for. Milestone for the cross-feature
release; the parent-issue tree for a single feature.

**Where metadata lives — parent vs. leaf.** The **parent** holds the durable
context: the spec (your Given/When/Then acceptance criteria), the "why," the
explicit *not*-doing reasoning, and — since sub-issues auto-inherit it — the
**milestone and project** assignment. Set those once on the parent and the tree
inherits; move the parent to `v1.1.0` and the whole tree moves with it. Never set
the milestone per child.

The **leaves** hold execution: the `Task` type and the **`Size` points**. Put
the estimate on the mergeable one-PR slices, not the parent — estimating a slice is
reliable, estimating a big parent isn't — and a view's field sums total the leaves
for you.
It's route-not-duplicate applied to hierarchy: a child references the parent's spec
rather than restating it, and reads up for context.

**Sub-issue vs. task-list checkbox.** Markdown `- [ ]` task lists still have a
place. The rule: if an item needs its own **status, assignee, or independent
scheduling**, promote it to a **sub-issue**; if it's just "steps to finish this one
issue," leave it a **checkbox** in the body. Don't promote every checkbox (that's
sprawl), and don't spin up a sub-issue where a checkbox suffices.

**Research child as a blocking gate.** When a Feature has an unknown, spawn a
**Research** sub-issue and let it *block* the implementation children. It closes
when it produces a decision record (the Research closure rule), which unblocks the
rest — encoding "figure this out first, then build" in the tree itself, and tying
Research, sub-issues, and the ADR discipline together.

**Hierarchy is not dependency.** A sub-issue means *"part of,"* not *"must happen
before."* If A must finish before B but B isn't part of A, that's a **dependency**
— the native blocked-by relationship, or the `blocked` label + a note (see
**Blocked is not a status** above) — not a parent-child link. Conflating them
corrupts the tree; keep composition (sub-issues) and sequencing (dependencies) in
separate mechanisms.

## Cross-repo work

The one board already spans every repo (the single default project per owner). For
work that *itself* crosses repos, reach for the tree, not a new field:

**A cross-repo feature → a parent sub-issue tree. No field needed.** A feature that
touches app + infra + marketing is one cohesive thing, so it's a legitimate parent:
the parent **Feature** issue lives in the app repo, its **Task** children live in
whichever repos they belong to (sub-issues cross repos freely), and the parent's
rollup counts completion across all of them. The tree *is* the cross-repo grouping
— you track it by opening the parent, not by tagging a field.

**A cross-repo *release* is mostly a smell.** Repos with genuinely independent
deploy cadences shouldn't share a release: the app cuts versions via release-please
on its own rhythm, an Astro marketing site deploys continuously on copy changes,
infra changes when infra changes. Forcing "app v1.1.0 + a pricing-page edit + a
terraform tweak" into one dated cross-repo release invents coordination the
independent cadences don't need. What legitimately spans repos is **features, not
releases** — so the flat cross-repo batch a milestone structurally can't hold (and
that a field would exist to solve) mostly shouldn't exist.

**The one genuine exception: a coordinated launch.** An initial public launch
really does need app-live + marketing-up + infra-provisioned at once — a real
cross-repo dated batch. Even then, model it as a single **Public Launch** parent
tracking issue with cross-repo sub-issues, not a new field: it's a one-time event,
not a recurring dimension worth a permanent field on every issue forever.

## Views

Views (the board's tabs) **can't be created via API** — Projects V2 exposes no
view mutations, only reads — so create these once in the UI (**Project → New
view**). Keep the saved set small; **slice the one board** (below) for the rest.

- **Board** — board, `is:open`, grouped by `Status`. The day-to-day working board.
- **Triage** — table, filtered to items **missing a `Priority`** or carrying
  **`needs-triage`**, grouped by **Type** (Bug / Feature / Task / Research) so you
  see the shape of the inbox. This is your grooming session — it exists so
  untriaged work can't hide; empty it regularly and it stays useful.
- **Agent queue** — board, filtered to issues whose **`Agent`** field is set,
  showing only the in-flight `Status` columns (**Ready, Agent Queue, In Progress,
  Verifying, In Review, Ready to Merge**), sorted by `Priority`.
- **Planning** — table, grouped by **`Product`** (or `Type`), sorted by
  `Priority`, with the **`Size` field summed in each group header**. The "how
  big is the pile, and what's the plan" view, and a **dates-free roadmap
  substitute**: the per-group sum shows the weight behind each product without
  maintaining a timeline. (`Size` is a **number** field — GitHub sums number
  fields in group headers, so this totals the points behind each group; a
  single-select can't be summed.)
- **Mine** — table, `is:open assignee:@me`, sorted by `Priority`.

### Two toggles, not more views

- **Show hierarchy** (sub-issues — public preview) — expands/collapses sub-issues
  up to 8 levels while still grouping, slicing, sorting, and filtering. Flip it on
  in the Board or Planning view for the parent-with-children rollup you'd
  otherwise reach for an Epic type to get — the payoff of choosing **sub-issues
  over Epics**: structure without the "Feature or Epic?" tax. Still preview, so
  expect rough edges.
- **Slice the board** — rather than separate per-product / per-layer / per-agent
  saved views, slice the one board: by **`Product`** when you go multi-product, by
  **`layer:`** to focus a system layer, by **`Agent`** to see the split. One
  board, many lenses — and how multiple products stay legible in one aggregating
  project instead of fragmenting into project-per-product.

## Notes

- **Labels vs Type** — `Type` is a first-class, org-level issue field
  (Bug / Feature / Task / Research), separate from labels (see **Labels** above);
  don't reproduce it as a label.
- **Owner**, **Iteration/cycle** — additional fields/axes as the work needs them
  (**Milestones** have their own section above).
- An issue can belong to **multiple projects** — the org project plus a focused
  one is fine.
