# Onboarding

Getting productive in Evan Harmon Website.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/evanharmon1/evan-harmon.git`
2. One-time machine setup (Homebrew, Node, pnpm): `task bootstrap`
3. Install dependencies and git hooks: `task install`
4. Verify everything works: `task verify`

Prefer the devcontainer? Open the repo in VS Code and "Reopen in Container"
(human profile: `.devcontainer/dev/`), or use a Coder workspace. See
[devcontainers.md](devcontainers.md) for local secrets (1Password Environments)
and Coder setup.

## Daily workflow

- Work on feature branches; direct commits to `main` are blocked.
- Conventional commit messages are enforced (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, ...).
- `task verify` before pushing; CI runs the same checks.
- Releases are intentional via release-please: merge the rolling release PR to
  publish (`task release:*` stays as a manual override).

## Where things are

See [the docs map](../README.md) for all documentation and the
[root README](../../README.md) for the project structure.

TODO: add project-specific context a new contributor needs.
