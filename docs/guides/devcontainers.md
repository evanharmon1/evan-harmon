# Devcontainers

Evan Harmon Website ships a **dual-profile** devcontainer. Both profiles share
one `Dockerfile` and the baked `.devcontainer/config/` tree; they differ in
which secrets and capabilities they allow.

| Profile | Path | For | Tailscale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bot** | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) | no |
| **Dev** | `.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.json` | humans | yes (`TS_AUTHKEY`, `--device=/dev/net/tun`) |

The bot profile intentionally omits `TS_AUTHKEY` from its allow-list so a tailnet
key never reaches an agent container.

**Claude permission mode differs by profile.** The **bot** defaults to
`bypassPermissions` (Claude runs tools without per-action prompts — the container
is the isolation boundary); the **dev** profile keeps the normal prompt-on-action
default so a human stays in the loop. The shared managed settings
(`config/claude-settings.json`) deliberately omit `defaultMode`; the bot opts in
at create time via `scripts/enable-claude-bypass.sh`. `bypassPermissions` is only
safe because it is container-scoped — it is never set on the host.

## Run it locally

- **VS Code:** "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" → pick the **Dev** profile
  (`.devcontainer/dev/`) for human use.
- **CLI:** `devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --config .devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.json`

Prebuilt images are pulled from GHCR as a build cache
(`ghcr.io/evanharmon1/evanharmon-site-devcontainer` / `ghcr.io/evanharmon1/evanharmon-site-devcontainer-dev`), so a warm rebuild
is fast. A cache miss is non-fatal — it just rebuilds from the `Dockerfile`.

## Secrets — 1Password Environments (the standard)

Don't hand-write or copy `devcontainer.env`. The standard is **1Password
Environments**, which mounts a virtual `.env` over a UNIX pipe — the values are
**never written to disk or committed** (the path is gitignored anyway).

1. In the **1Password** app → **Developer** → **Environments**, create an
   environment for this repo (import an existing `.env` or add the variables
   below, each referencing a vault item).
2. Set the destination to **Local .env file** and point the mount at
   `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (bot). Add a second destination at
   `.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.env` for the dev profile.
3. Authorize access when prompted. The container's `--env-file` then reads it
   like any `.env`.

Variables per profile:

| Variable | Bot | Dev | What it's for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GH_TOKEN` | ✅ | ✅ | `gh` CLI / API |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | ✅ | ✅ | Claude Code |
| `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY` | ✅ | ✅ | agent-deck bridge (optional) |
| `TS_AUTHKEY` | — | ✅ | Tailscale (dev only) |

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is deliberately **forbidden** — it silently overrides
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, so `init-env.sh` strips it from the env-file.

### What `init-env.sh` does

On container init the devcontainer runs `.devcontainer/scripts/init-env.sh` on
the **host**. It enforces the per-profile allow-list (e.g. evicts `TS_AUTHKEY`
and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the bot env-file on every rebuild) and, in
environments where the 1Password app isn't present (**Coder / Codespaces**),
captures the same variables from the **host environment**, where they arrive as
workspace/template parameters. It does **not** call `op` itself — 1Password
Environments is what supplies the values locally.

## Run it in Coder

The devcontainers are Coder-ready: the `CODER` env is passed through, the
`config/` tree is baked to `/usr/local/share/devcontainer-config/` so it
survives Coder's `/tmp` mount shadowing, and `init-env.sh` reads secrets from
the host environment (above).

What Coder needs is a **workspace template** that clones this repo and builds the
devcontainer — that template is **org-level infrastructure, not part of this
repo** (one template serves every repo). To stand this repo up in Coder:

1. Use your org's Coder "devcontainer" template (the canonical example is
   `terraform/coder/devcontainer/` in
   [harmonops/harmon-infra](https://github.com/harmonops/harmon-infra)). It uses
   the Coder `git-clone` + `devcontainers-cli` modules.
2. Create a workspace from it and set the parameters:
   - **repo** → `https://github.com/evanharmon1/evanharmon-site`
   - secrets → `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY`
     (+ `TS_AUTHKEY` if you want Tailscale). Coder passes these into the
     workspace's host environment, where `init-env.sh` picks them up.
3. The build pulls `ghcr.io/evanharmon1/evanharmon-site-devcontainer` from GHCR as a cache. If that
   package is private, give the Coder builder a read token (or make the package
   public); a cache miss only makes the first build slower.

> Unlike harmon-infra, this repo's `Dockerfile` uses the **public** Microsoft
> base image, so the classic-PAT / private-base-image (`ghcr_read_token`)
> complication does not apply here — only the repo's own `-devcontainer` cache
> image matters.

## Working on related repos

To work across several repos in one container, list them in
`.devcontainer/related-repos.txt` (one `owner/repo` per line; `@branch`, full
URLs, and ssh URLs also work). They are:

- **cloned** into `/workspaces/`, beside this repo, on container **create**
  (`scripts/bootstrap-related-repos.sh`) — so a rebuilt or persistence-lost
  container re-populates them;
- **fetched** non-destructively on container **start**
  (`scripts/fetch-related-repos.sh`).

Both are safe to re-run: an already-cloned sibling is **never clobbered** —
clone skips it, and start runs `git fetch` only (never pull / merge / checkout),
so uncommitted work, local commits, and the checked-out branch stay put. The
list is preserved across `copier update` (an empty list is a no-op).

To let Claude read and search the cloned siblings, add them to
`.claude/settings.json` in **two** places — `permissions.additionalDirectories`
(Claude's own Read/Grep/Glob tools) and `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` (the Bash
sandbox):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "additionalDirectories": ["../sibling-repo"]
  },
  "sandbox": {
    "filesystem": {
      "allowRead": ["../sibling-repo"]
    }
  }
}
```
