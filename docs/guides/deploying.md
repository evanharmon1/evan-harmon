# Deploying

How to deploy Evan Harmon Website. For the shape of the CI/CD pipeline see
[../architecture/ci-cd.md](../architecture/ci-cd.md); for production operational
procedures and rollback runbooks see [../runbooks/](../runbooks/).

The site is served by the `evanharmon-site` **Cloudflare Worker** (static
assets, configured in [`wrangler.jsonc`](../../wrangler.jsonc)). All deploys
run from GitHub Actions via `cloudflare/wrangler-action`. Custom domains are
managed outside wrangler (Terraform `cloudflare_workers_custom_domain`, or the
dashboard).

- **Preview**: every same-repo PR uploads a non-production Worker *version*
  (`deploy-preview.yml`) — versioned + branch-alias URLs on workers.dev,
  posted as a sticky PR comment. Preview versions never receive production
  traffic. Skips gracefully when `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is unavailable.
- **Production**: merging the release-please release PR makes `release.yml`
  build the tagged commit and run `wrangler deploy`. Normal merges to `main`
  do **not** deploy production.
- **Bootstrap / rollback**: Actions → *Release Please* → *Run workflow* with a
  branch or tag deploys that ref directly — used once to create the Worker,
  and to redeploy the previous release tag.

Credentials: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is an org-level Actions **variable** (an
identifier, not a secret); `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is a repo **secret** — an
Account API Token scoped to **Account → Workers Scripts → Edit** only, 1-year
TTL with a renewal reminder (rotate via the token's Roll button + re-run
`gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`). Also create `preview` and `production`
GitHub Environments (see the post-generation CHECKLIST).

## Environments

TODO: list the environments (e.g. preview, staging, production) and where each
one lives.

## How to deploy

TODO: the steps or command to ship a change. Prefer a `task deploy` (or
`deploy:<target>`) task so it stays the single source of truth.

Build the production bundle with `task build` first.

## Rollback

TODO: how to roll back a bad deploy. Capture the production procedure as a
runbook in [../runbooks/](../runbooks/).

## Configuration & secrets

TODO: deploy-time configuration and where secrets come from (1Password / CI
secrets — see [../architecture/security.md](../architecture/security.md)).
