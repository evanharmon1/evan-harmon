# Coverage note: the bootstrap assertion only exercises the "Homebrew already
# installed" path, so it is skipped on runners without brew (e.g. the default
# ubuntu-latest CI). It still guards the common local/macOS case — the exact
# regression where `task bootstrap` aborted on a sudo precheck despite brew
# already being installed.
