// Automated accessibility checks — the WCAG 2.x A/AA rules axe can detect.
// axe finds only ~a third to half of WCAG issues: this is the automated FLOOR,
// not a substitute for keyboard / screen-reader testing. Tag a11y tests
// `@a11y` so `task test:a11y` selects them. Requires @playwright/test and
// @axe-core/playwright as devDependencies (add them if missing) plus an
// install run with your package manager — until then `tsc` / `astro check`
// can't type-check this file.

// Chromium only: axe analyzes the DOM, so results don't vary by engine, and
// CI installs just chromium — any firefox/webkit projects in the playwright
// config would fail to launch there. Skipped before fixtures, so no browser
// binary is needed for the skipped projects.
test.skip(({ browserName }) => browserName !== 'chromium', 'a11y (axe) runs on chromium only');

// Emulate prefers-reduced-motion: entrance animations otherwise race axe —
// mid-animation opacity blends foreground colors into false color-contrast
// violations on styles that are AA-clean when settled. Reduced motion renders
// final styles immediately (and exercises the site's own reduced-motion
// support). Since Playwright 1.61, reducedMotion lives under use.contextOptions.
test.use({ contextOptions: { reducedMotion: 'reduce' } });

// The reason axe-in-Playwright beats Lighthouse: test INTERACTIVE states too.
// Uncomment and adapt once the app has real UI:
// test('nav menu (open) has no violations @a11y', async ({ page }) => {
//   await page.goto('/')
//   await page.getByRole('button', { name: /menu/i }).click()
//   const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze()
//   expect(results.violations).toEqual([])
// })
